# 🚀 Integration Playground

> A hands-on learning project for mastering **Frends iPaaS** through a real-world enterprise integration scenario.

> **Project Status**

> This repository is continuously updated while studying Frends Fundamentals and building a real-world integration project.

## 📖 About the Project

Integration Playground is a portfolio and learning project created to gain practical experience with **Frends Integration Platform (iPaaS)**.

The project follows a realistic software delivery lifecycle—from business requirements and solution architecture to process implementation, monitoring, deployment, and documentation.

Rather than studying isolated concepts, the project evolves around a single business scenario where every new Frends concept is applied in practice.

## 🎯 Project Goals

By completing this project I aim to:

- Learn Frends Fundamentals through practical implementation.
- Understand enterprise integration architecture.
- Build reusable integration processes.
- Design and document API contracts.
- Apply integration best practices.
- Prepare for the **Frends Fundamentals Certification**.
- Build a portfolio-quality integration project.

## 🏗️ Project Scenario

A charity organization receives donations through its web application.

When a donor submits a donation, the integration platform is responsible for orchestrating the complete business workflow:

- Receive the donation request
- Validate incoming data
- Verify campaign information
- Synchronize donor information with CRM
- Register the donation in ERP
- Send a confirmation email
- Store reporting information
- Return the execution result

This workflow will gradually evolve throughout the project as new Frends concepts are introduced.
